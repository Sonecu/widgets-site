I'm assuming you have a stellar wallet. If not, go get one from the official curated list of options here: https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/

I'm going to keep this general since I don't know what type of stellar wallet you have.

Let's look at a sample widget:

<div id="dawg"></div>

<br />
Click `Support`. See the _Stellar Address_ and _Memo_? From your web wallet, start a transaction; a request to send lumens to a destination.
Set the destination to the Stellar address listed and set the memo field to what the widgets lists under _memo_.

Easy? Awesome. If not, feel free to create an issue here: https://github.com/Toneco/Widget/issues.
